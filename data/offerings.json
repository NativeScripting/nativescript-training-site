Anyone can register for an open enrollment hands-on class. Students attend the class in person in a classroom with a highly skilled and experienced instructor. Most of our classes are taught by the author of the course. This ensures you are not getting someone else’s interpretation of the course, but instead you are getting real world expert instruction and guidance.",

Each lecture is filled with multiple instructor led demos so students can see what is being presented in action. At the completion of each lecture, students are given ample time to complete a step-by-step hands-on lab that offers hands on experience. The manual each student receives on the first day includes a copy of all the slides from the lectures as well as the hands-on lab. Students are free to take notes in the manual as the manuals are for the students to keep. In addition, most classes contain an associated ZIP file that includes sample code, utilities and other great assets students use throughout the class (such as in the hands-on labs).</p>"
